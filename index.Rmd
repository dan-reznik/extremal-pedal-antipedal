# Introducion

Given a triangle $T={V_1}{V_2}{V_3}$, its *pedal triangle* with respect to a point $P$ (called the *pedal point*) is defined by the feet of perpendiculars from $P$ onto the sides of $T$. Additionally, the *antipedal triangle* (also with respect to $P$) has sides through $V_i$ perpendicular to $(V_i-P)$ (its vertices lie at the intersection of said sides) [@mw].

- insert figure of pedal and antipedal w/ Q

# Sturm's Theorem (1823)

- circular isocurves of pedal area

# Steiner's Theorem: Kr√ºmmungs Schwerpunkt

- K = media dos sin(2theta), i.e., X3 on a triangle

- isocurves of pedal area are circular (Sturm's generalized)
- pedal with respect to K is extremal

- reference german paper
- reference website about constant area

# Iso-Curves of the Antipedal Triangle

## Gallatly's Theorem

- X4,X3 is isogonal pair
- since the pedal wrt X3 is maximal, $A'(P) A''(P^*)  = A^2$. since A'(P) is maximal when P=X3, then A''(P^*) must be minimal at X4=isog of X3.
- the minimal antipedal is the anticomplementary triangle.
- the maximal pedal is the medial triangle.
