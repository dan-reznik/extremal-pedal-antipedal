# Introduction

Given a reference triangle $T={V_1}{V_2}{V_3}$ (shown blue below), its *pedal triangle* $T'$ (red) with respect to a point $P$ (called the *pedal point*) is defined by the feet of perpendiculars from $P$ onto the sides of $T$. Additionally, the *antipedal triangle* $T''$ with respect to $P$ (green) has sides through $V_i$ perpendicular to $(V_i-P)$ (its vertices lie at the intersection of said sides) [@mw].

# Sturm's Theorem

In 1823, a then 20 year old Jacques Charles François Sturm (1803-1855), famously known for his Sturm–Liouville theory, proved the following remarkable fact [@ostermann2012]: 

>The isocurves of constant area of the pedal polygon $T'$ are circles centered on the Circumcenter $X_3$.


This is aptly illustrated in Figure 7.31, page 221 in [@ostermann2012], with $O$ representing $X_3$:

```{r,out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("pics/sturm-ostermann.png")
```

Sturm also showed that for each isocircle, the signed area $A'$ of $T'$ is given by:

$$
A'=\frac{A}{4}[1-(\frac{d}{R})^2]
$$

Where $A$ is the area of the reference $T$, $d$ is the radius of the isocircle, and $R$ the circumradius, respectively. The formula implies that $A'=A/4$ is maximal at $d=0$, i.e., $P=X_3$. So the extremal area pedal triangle is the pedal with respect to $X_3$, i.e., the *medial* triangle, with vertices at the midpoint of the sides of $T$.

Note that when $d<R$ the area is positive (the vertices of both $T$ and $T'$ are ordered alike). At $d=R$, $P$ is on the circumcircle and $T'$ degenerates to a zero-area triangle known as the Simson Line [@mw]. For $d>R$, the vertices of the pedal are in reverse order with respect to $T$ and its signed area becomes negative.

# Steiner's Curvature Centroid

A short 2 years later, eminent mathematician Jakob Steiner (1796-1863), only 6 years Sturm's senior, generalized Sturm's result to all polygons. He discovered that a special point $K$ called the *Curvature Centroid* (der "Krümmungs-Schwerpunkt") can be computed for any polygon with respect to which the pedal polygons has extremal area [@steiner1838]. Let $V_i,\theta_i$ denote an N-gon vertices and internal angles. $K$ is given by:

$$
K = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N{\sin(2\theta_i)V_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^N{\sin(2\theta_i)}}
$$

Steiner proves the area will be maximal (resp. minimal) if $\sum_i{sin(2\theta_i)}$ is positive (resp.  negative). Notice that for triangles, this sum is always positive, i.e., the extremal area pedal is maximal. For parallelograms, the sum of double-angle sines is zero. Indeed, the area of pedal polygons to this shape is invariant over $P$. 

**Corollary**: the Centroid of Curvature for a triangle is $X_3$, since its barycentrics are $sin(2\theta_i)$, confirming Sturm's result.

## Correcting X(1115)

According to [Mathworld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SteinerCurvatureCentroid.html) [@mw], the triangle center with barycentrics $\pi-\theta_i$ was named by Honsberger (1995) "Steiner's Curvature Centroid", listed as $X_{1115}$ on ETC [@etc]. This could be confusing and/or erroneous. Steiner's Curvature Centroid for a triangle is simply $X_3$.

Note: as of July 10, 2020, Prof. Clark Kimberling has already changed $X_{1115}$ to *Exterior-Angle Curvature Centroid* [@etc].

# Minimal-Area Antipedal 

It turns out the minimal-area antipedal is the one with respect to the Orthocenter $X_4$. This is a corollary from theorem by Gallatly, page 58 [@gallatly1914]:

>Let $T$ be a triangle and $T'$ its pedal with respect to a point $P$. Let $T^{*}$ be the antipedal of $T$ with respect to $P^*$, the isogonal conjugate of $P$. Let $A,A',A^{*}$ denote the areas of the three mentioned triangles. Then, $A'A^{*}=A^2$.  

Recall $X_4$ is the isogonal conjugate of $X_3$. Suppose another point $Y$ existed with respect to which an antipedal had area lower than $A^*$. With $A$ constant, this would imply a pedal with respect to $Y^*$, the isogonal of $Y$, of area higher than $A'$, a contradiction since $A'$ is maximal.

So the minimal antipedal is the anticomplementary triangle [@mw], whose area is $4A$. As before, the antipedal's maximal-area pedal polygon will be its medial, i.e., the original $T$ itself.

<!--An elegant theorem appearing in [@gallatly] states that the isogonal conjugate of the antipedal triangle of $T$ with respect to a point $P$ is the antipedal triangle of $T$ with respect to $P^*$, the isogonal conjugate of P.

It is also homothetic with the pedal triangle of DeltaABC with respect to P. Furthermore, the product of the areas of the two homothetic triangles equals the square of the area of the original triangle (Gallatly 1913, pp. 56-58).

A beautiful theorem appearing in [@gallatly]

- X4,X3 is isogonal pair
- since the pedal wrt X3 is maximal, $A'(P) A''(P^*)  = A^2$. since A'(P) is maximal when P=X3, then A''(P^*) must be minimal at X4=isog of X3.
- the minimal antipedal is the anticomplementary triangle.
- the maximal pedal is the medial triangle. -->

## Iso-curves of Antipedal Area

Shown below are the non-linear isocurves of antipedal triangle area with respect to points in the plane. From left to right: acute, right, and obtuse triangles are shown. The minimal-area antipedal (anticomplementary triangle) is shown green on the first and third plot, as is this triangle's Circumcenter $X_3'$ (reference $X_4$). Note zero-area iso-curves along the circumcircle, where the antipedal triangle shrinks to a point. Also note that for the 2nd case, $X_4$ is on the right angle vertex.
